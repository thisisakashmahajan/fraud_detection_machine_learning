**Description:**

India is the largest vendor of online payments. Few years ago, we could have barely seen the online payment details
in an airport coffee shop. Today, even a small sweet shop owner has UPI payment QR code installed at doorstep.
This technology transition and social development invited the hoaxers and attackers to develop fraudulent transactions 
and fool people for some amount of money. Fortunately, the online transactions are monitored and hence could be analyzed using the latest tools. In this study, an
attempt is made to develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions in a transactions' dataset. 

This project is completed under Internship program by CodeClause. The dataset does not contain sensitive information
such as person's name, Aadhar Card, ATM PIN etc., so we strictly avoid privacy invasion. 
The experiments carried on the dataset could be applicable to similar business scenario.
